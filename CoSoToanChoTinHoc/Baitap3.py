# Optimization with equality constraints
# Suppose we have a refinery that must ship fnished goods to some storage tanks.
# Suppose further that there are two pipelines, A and B, to do the shipping.
# The cost of shipping x units on A is ax2; the cost of shipping y units on B is by2, where a = 5 and b = 7.
# How can we ship 100 units while minimizing cost.
